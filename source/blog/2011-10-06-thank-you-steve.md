We built this framework with Steve’s Mac, with Steve’s OS, with Steve and Apple inside.

We strive like him to think differently every day for us and for you; Steve changed the world and we dream to change the web.

Thank you to Steve and to all men who have thought differently and in doing so, have changed everything.
