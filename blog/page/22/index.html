In order to create the smoothest experience possible for Padrino users, we decided that these bugs warranted a new release ahead of schedule. So, today we have released 0.9.13 (and 0.9.12) with a few bug fixes and a deprecation of the mount_core method. Read on to get the full rundown.</p>

<p>This latest release is a quick bug fix patch release for a few outstanding issues in 0.9.11. First, there was an issue with the admin panel intermittently displaying in Czech rather than the english locale. This was due to a faulty key in the localization file for Czech in admin.</p>

<p>The second bug had to do with routing failures in which certain routes wouldn’t behave as expected if the same path was defined twice with two different verbs (GET ‘/index’ and POST ‘/index’) as well as errors with the handling of provides and explicit formats. An updated http_router and changes to routing in Padrino has addressed these issues in 0.9.13.</p>

<p>Finally, we have deprecated the mounting syntax related to ‘core’ applications. Prior to 0.9.13, the following code was generated in a new project:</p>

<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>Padrino.mount_core("BlogDemo")
</code></pre>

<p>This is actually somewhat confusing and hides what the mounter is actually doing. In the latest release, <code>mount_core</code> is deprecated and the following is used instead:</p>

<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>Padrino.mount("BlogDemo").to("/")
</code></pre>

<p>This is a minor change but important as this command is much more consistent and adheres to our philosophy of minimizing ‘magical’ behavior in our framework.</p>

<p>The quick version of these fixes is recapped below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Deprecated mount_core and remove references</li>
  <li>Fixed problem with czech translation file</li>
  <li>Fixed a problem with routes with same path but different verbs and provides</li>
</ul>

<p>Please update your applications to 0.9.13 and continue enjoy using Padrino!</p>

Two of the core Padrino team members, Nathan and Arthur, recently had an opportunity to chat on air when Adam and Wynn decided to devote an entire episode to Padrino! The podcast runs for about 32 minutes and includes a nice discussion about Rack, Middleware, Sinatra and Padrino. Read the full blog post to listen to the interview!</p>

<p>You can visit the <a href="http://thechangelog.com/post/708173099/episode-0-2-7-padrino-ruby-web-framework">Padrino episode</a> page to view the entire show notes with excellent related links and resources mentioned in the discussion.</p>

<p>We would also like to reiterate a few resources here which are particularly valuable for Padrino developers:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://rack.rubyforge.org">Rack Website</a> – If you are using Padrino (built on Rack), you should eventually become familiar with the underlying “Rack” architecture. It is easy to understand and really helps give you a better picture of what is involved with a web application behind the scenes.</li>
  <li><a href="http://coderack.org">CodeRack</a> – Rack middleware is an excellent way to add functionality to your project without having to do any implementation work in your application. There is rack middleware to do everything from <a href="http://github.com/achiu/rack-recaptcha">displaying a captcha</a> to <a href="http://github.com/intridea/omniauth">authenticating users</a> and even <a href="http://github.com/juliocesar/rack-bundle">bundling your assets</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://github.com/pengwynn/presto">Presto</a> – Wynn’s shameless port of Nesta CMS to Padrino powering his own site</li>
  <li><a href="http://wiki.github.com/padrino/padrino-framework/extensions">Padrino Extensions</a> – A starting set of Padrino extensions and recommended libraries for various common requirements</li>
</ul>

<p>The Padrino team would like to thank <a href="http://adamstacoviak.com">Adam</a> and <a href="http://wynnnetherland.com">Wynn</a> very much for this excellent show they put together every week and for having us on to discuss Padrino at length. We know both of them are fans of Padrino and just chatting with them was great fun.</p>
